Xilinx Corp., San Jose | Summer 2017

Research on the Xilinx FPGA tool-chain and developed a prototype of FPGA cutting edge debugging features. Developed cutting edge debugging features using compiler techniques in newly being developed SDx tool chain. This is meant to allow application developers with little or no FPGA expertise to use high level programming languages such as OpenCL, C and C++ to program FPGAs.
