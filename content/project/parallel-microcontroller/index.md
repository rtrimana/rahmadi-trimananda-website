University of Pelita Harapan, Jakarta, Indonesia | 2005 - 2006

Developed a prototype of parallel processors with microcontrollers. The system consists of up to four configurable microcontrollers that communicate with one another in a master-slave hierarchy. The project involves designing algorithms for parallelizing tasks, communication between processing nodes, result aggregation, and interfacing with outside world..
