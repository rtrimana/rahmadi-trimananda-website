<span style="background-color:yellow"><font color="black"> **I'm on the job market in 2023, looking for a research scientist position in industry!</font>**</span>

I am currently a Project Scientist in [the Networking Group led by Prof. Athina Markopoulou at University of California, Irvine](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/) and the [ProperData Center](https://properdata.eng.uci.edu/). I currently work on the intersection between computer science and engineering, namely hardware and software, policy, and laws, with emphasis on security and privacy, especially for Internet of Things (IoT).

<!--- 
- **System**: a computing system consists of hardware and software; such system may have observable outputs, such as network traffic.
- **Policy**: a policy document, such as a privacy policy, describes the data collection practices of the system.
- **Laws**: data privacy laws, such as the [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) and [CCPA](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) provide the minimum requirements to an organization on how to disclose their practices in a policy.

Previously, in 2015 - 2020, I was part of [the Programming Languages Group as Ph.D. student, advised by Prof. Brian Demsky](https://plrg.ics.uci.edu/), working on the [security, privacy, and safety of the smart home devices](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2478599991?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true).

Prior to that, I was a: 
- Senior System Validation Engineer at [Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) in 2012 - 2015, in which I performed post-silicon validation on mainstream Intel microprocessors and SoCs,
- Lecturer at the University of Pelita Harapan in 2009 - 2011, during which I was also a [Microsoft Innovation Center Manager and our team won Top 10 National for Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://dailysocial.id/post/imagine-cup-indonesia-announced-10-semifinalists),
- Graduate researcher at the [Circuits and Systems lab at TU Delft with Prof. Edoardo Charbon](http://cas.tudelft.nl/People/bio.php?id=36) (currently at EPFL) in 2008 - 2009, during which I worked on the [deep-submicron CMOS SPAD technology, which is mass-produced since 2015 and is present in smartphones, telemeters, proximity sensors, and medical diagnostics tools](https://people.epfl.ch/edoardo.charbon?lang=en).
